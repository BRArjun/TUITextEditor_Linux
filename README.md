# CursesEditor

This is a basic TUI Text editor made with curses in Python and packaged using PyInstaller.

## Features

- **Simple and intuitive interface**: CursesEditor offers a clean and minimalistic interface, allowing you to focus on your text editing without any distractions.
- **File management**: Open, save, and create new text files directly from the editor.
- **Configurable keybindings**: Customize keyboard shortcuts to suit your preferences.
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: CursesEditor is designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
- **Inbuilt AI Functionality**: This editor comes with free AI functionality embedded into it using the Groq API.
To access this you will need to have an API key for Groq yourself.

Make sure that you have windows-ncurses before using this project on Windows(have not yet verified that it is working)

## Installation

CursesEditor is packaged as a standalone executable using PyInstaller, so you don't need to install Python or any dependencies separately. Simply download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/BRArjun/TUITextEditor/releases) page and run the executable file.

For Linux and macOS users:

```bash
chmod +x TUITextEditor  # Make the file executable
./TUITextEditor          # Run the editor
```
